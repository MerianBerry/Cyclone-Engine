# What is Lunar?
LunarGE (Game engine / Graphics Engine) is a heavy in-development light-ish weight engine written in c++, and uses the Vulkan graphics api. *Planned* supported scripting languages are c++, lua, and python.

### *NOTE: this readme is in progress, as things arent set in stone yet*

[Heres](docs/documentation.md) the documentation (not close to being worked on)

## Structure

*(IN PROGRESS)* The structure of LunarGE has *not* reached its final form, I lied:

**Lunarge Instance**
- Vulkan instance
- Vulkan Debug messanger
- Vulkan Command pool
- Vulkan swapchain
- Vulkan Device & Physical Device

**Global scripts**
